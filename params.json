{"name":"Keyguidemaker","tagline":"KeyGuardMaker","body":"#KeyGuideMaker#\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of KeyGuide components. It includes:\r\n\r\n* [a line command tool](/#keyguidemakerpy) (KeyGuideMaker.py) - see info below on this\r\n* [a web front end](html/) (you can see a live version of this [here](http://keyguides.sourceymonkey.com))\r\n* [a directory of keyguide templates](/templates) and [a syntax for creating them (XML files with SVG)](/templates#readme)\r\n\r\nWe also have a directory of ready-compiled, ready-to-print designs that need no tool to get going with. (YET TO BE INCLUDED)\r\n\r\nIf you want to make templates you will need to read this easy to read guide (YET TO BE WRITTEN! In short - take image, import into ai/inkscape. Resize to correct actual screen size. Draw boxes (0.01mm stroke), Export as SVG. Write brief XML file.)\r\n\r\n##Credits##\r\n\r\nSimon Judge and Will Wade wrote this with some testing and support from Marie and original designs by [Chris](http://christopherjbarr.weebly.com/).\r\nThanks to [Fablab Manchester](http://www.fablabmanchester.org) for helping to cut and trial Simon and Marie's designs.\r\n\r\n#KeyGuideMaker.py#\r\n\r\nThis is a line command tool to combine multiple SVG elements into one. It allows for the most flexibility. \r\n\r\n##Installation:##\r\n\r\n* [Python](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/)\r\n* [svg_utils](https://github.com/btel/svg_utils)\r\n\r\nIf you want to develop the web front end you will also want to install the line command tools of [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) \r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install imagemagick \r\n\r\nshould do the trick. This will allow the conversion of the final image to other formats. \r\n\r\nYou may also want to use [InkScape](http://inkscape.org/) to do any little personal editing after the basic keyguide has been created (e.g. convert to PDF, EPS or change the line thickness for different laser cutting machines)\r\n\r\n##Usage##\r\n\r\n    /KeyGuideMaker.py -h\r\n    usage: KeyGuideMaker [-h] [--type TYPE] [--designs DESIGNS] [--output OUTPUT]\r\n                         [--filename FILENAME] [--formachine FORMACHINE]\r\n                         [--version]\r\n\r\n    Creates keyguides from xml design files and svgs. Use like: /KeyGuideMaker.py\r\n    -t iPad -d \"TouchChat-80,iPadHomeButton\" -f will\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help            \r\n                            show this help message and exit\r\n      \r\n      --type TYPE, -t TYPE  \r\n                            What device are these for? iPad, iPadMini, Powerbox?\r\n      \r\n      --designs DESIGNS, -d DESIGNS\r\n                            list the name of the designs you want to convert to a guide.\r\n                              NB: uses the filenames of the XML files\r\n      \r\n      --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT\r\n                            Not working. EPS, SVG, PDF, PS\r\n      \r\n      --filename FILENAME, -f FILENAME\r\n                            Name of the final keyguide image that gets created\r\n      \r\n      --formachine FORMACHINE, -m FORMACHINE\r\n                            Change the format of the file ready for a particular machine.\r\n                              e.g ponoko or razorlab need blue instead of black.\r\n      \r\n      --version             Get version number\r\n      \r\nFor example: To make a keyguide of TouchChat-80 with a home button and some suckers for attachment, called \"TouchChatKeyGuide.svg\" and ready it for [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com) (who use blue lines for cutting) use:\r\n\r\n    ./KeyGuideMaker.py -t iPad -d \"TouchChat-80,iPadHomeButton,iPadSuckers\"  -m ponoko -f TouchChatKeyGuide\r\n    \r\nFor a list of ready available components to add to your keyguide look at the [templates directory](templates/). \r\n\r\n##Licence##\r\n\r\n![CC-A](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png)\r\nThis is part of the Open Assistive Technology Initiative.
